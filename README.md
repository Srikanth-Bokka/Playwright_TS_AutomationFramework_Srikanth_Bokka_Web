  ```bash
  npm run tests:CHROME
  ```
  ```bash
  npm run tests:EDGE
  ```
  ```bash
  npm run tests:FIREFOX
  ```
  ```bash
  npm run tests:WEBKIT
  ```
  ```bash
  npm run tests:CHROMIUM
  ```

- Execution in Headless mode:
  ```bash
  npm run tests:CHROME:HEADLESS
  ```

## üìÅ Project Structure

The tests follow a modular and maintainable structure:

```
|-- .github
|     |-- workflows
|          |-- 01_ui_tests_chrome.yml
|          |-- 02_ui_tests_select_one.yml
|          |-- 03_ui_tests_ALL.yml
|-- pages
|     |-- BasePage.ts
|     |-- CartPage.ts
|     |-- Components.ts
|     |-- LoginPage.ts
|     |-- ProductsPage.ts
|-- allure-results/          # Allure test results (generated after test execution)
|-- allure-report/           # Allure HTML report (generated after report generation)
|-- test-data
|     |-- login_credentials.json
|-- tests-saucedemo
|     |-- components.spec.ts
|     |-- login.spec.ts
|-- utils
|     |-- VerificationUtils.ts
|     |-- WaitUtils.ts
|-- .gitignore
|-- package.json
|-- playwright.config.ts
```

- `allure-results`: Contains Allure test results generated after test execution.
- `allure-report`: Contains the generated Allure HTML report with detailed test analytics and visualizations.
- `pages`: Contains the Page Object Model (POM) classes representing web pages and their elements.
- `playwright-report`: Contains the HTML report for tests (Logs, Screenshots, Traces and Videos are attached).
- `test-data`: Contains external files (example: login credentials data) that can be used to mock data during tests.
- `tests-saucedemo`: Contains the actual test files. You can organize your tests into subdirectories as needed. 
- `utils`: Contains the Utilities that provides methods for asserting different conditions on web elements, waits.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- Modify `playwright.config.ts` for playwright configuration settings such as
  - `baseURL`
  - `testDir`
  - `reporter`
  - `fullyParallel`
  - `video`
  - `screenshot`
  - `trace`

## üîÑ Continuous Integration

This project is configured for CI using Github Actions. Check the configurations in `.github/workflows/*.yml`.

- `01_ui_tests_chrome.yml`: This workflow executes tests in Chrome browser.

- `02_ui_tests_select_one.yml`: This workflow will first ask User to select the browser for tests execution.

- `03_ui_tests_ALL.yml`: This workflow executes the tests in all browsers <!-- #(CHROME, EDGE, WEBKIT, CHROMIUM, FIREFOX) -->

## üìä Reporting

This framework uses **Allure Report** for comprehensive test reporting. Allure provides detailed test execution reports with rich features like:

- **Test Execution Timeline**: Visual representation of test execution flow
- **Environment Information**: Detailed system and test environment details
- **Test Categories**: Automatic categorization of tests (failed, broken, skipped, passed)
- **Attachments**: Screenshots, logs, and other test artifacts
- **Trends**: Historical test execution trends and statistics
- **Custom Categories**: Ability to create custom test categories and filters

### Running Tests and Generating Reports

1. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   npm run playwright:tests
   ```

2. **Generate and open Allure report:**
   ```bash
   npm run allure:report
   ```

3. **Generate report only (without opening):**
   ```bash
   npm run allure:generate
   ```

### Allure Report Structure

- `allure-results/`: Contains raw test execution data
- `allure-report/`: Contains the generated HTML report (created when you run the report command)

### Prerequisites for Allure

Make sure you have Allure command-line tool installed:

**macOS (using Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install allure
```

**Windows (using Scoop):**
```bash
scoop install allure
```

**Linux:**
```bash
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:qameta/allure
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install allure
```
